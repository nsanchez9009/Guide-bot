## How To Use

Guide does not have a prefix and only uses slash commands. To use slash commands, all you have to do is type <code>/</code> and you're ready to choose any command. Slash commands allow you to view every command and prevent errors using validation and error handling help allowing you to always get the command right.

## Invite
Guide is not available 24/7 yet.

You can [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=981768485493415986&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) Guide to your server but, due to discord, slash commands have a delay for when they will be available to use. Just wait a bit and they will eventually show up and be available to use. The only way for it to be instant is if I were to take your guild id and put it into Guide's enabled guilds parameter (this would be unreasonable).
